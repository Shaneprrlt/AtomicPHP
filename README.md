#AtomicPHP Framework#

The AtomicPHP Framework is a PHP5.3+ framework meaning that it will work only with versions of php 5.3 and up. This is because Atomic's autoloader works on namespaces which only became available in this release of php.

Atomic is very small, very fast, and is built to help many ideas come to life very quickly. It has everything you need to get your ideas out without the unnecessary features like ORM, etc.

Please bear in mind that AtomicPHP is in version 0.1.0 and is still very much in an Alpha stage. Things are still being written, kinks being worked out, but as of this release, Atomic is functional.
