#AtomicPHP Core#

AtomicPHP is an open-source PHP5.3+ HMVC Framework. HMVC stands for Hierarchal Model View Controller. It works similarly to the MVC pattern, except that you can have hierarchies of MVC patterns to make your application run much cleaner and more organized internally and externally.

AtomicPHP core can be used independent of ActiveRecord, ActiveResource, and HTTP; using these libraries however is highly recommended for quick and speedy development of your application.
